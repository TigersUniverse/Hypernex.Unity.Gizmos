# Hypernex.Unity.Gizmos
A repository for publicly made Gizmos for Hypernex.Unity

## How to Use

You can select a directory in here for gizmos and whatnot to use in your own Hypernex-related projects. Each directory should also have a README with a download and instructions on how to use them.

It is important to note that most, if not all, of these project will require the Hypernex.CCK to be loaded in your Unity project. You can grab a download from the [Hypernex Dashboard](https://play.hypernex.dev/).

## Contributing

Simply, make whatever assets in Unity, then export whatever is needed (excluding any dependencies) to a unitypackage. PR the additions to the main branch in its own directory, including any scripts as their own in the directory, and leave the unitypackage as an artifact. From there, a release can be made.
